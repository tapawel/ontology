Instructions and additional information: the framework of the system described in the article is an information-analytical Internet resource built on the basis of the ontology of the field of knowledge "Support for solving computationally complex problems of mathematical physics on supercomputers". To develop the ontology, we used the free Protégé editor (https://protege.stanford.edu/). The ontology is bilingual. To view it in Protégé, select File → Open →<spsc_2021-05-26.ttl>. Then configure the display of internal names in English, File →  Preferences→  Renderer →  Entity rendering →  Render by annotation property. After that, the user can see how different ontology elements are connected and what attributes they possess. Therefore, one can fully customize it for his own purposes: add new elements, set connections, properties, etc. The navigation is very intuitive and should not cause any trouble to understand. The Internet resource (https://uniserv.iis.nsk.su/spsc/) is being developed using the technology of creating intelligent scientific Internet resources (Institute of Informatics Systems named after A.P. Ershov, Novosibirsk, Russia). The developers provide a wrapper for a resource and a methodology for using it. To obtain them freely for non-commercial purposes, please contact zagor@iis.nsk.su.
